# adventOfCode_2024

In this repository you will find atrocious code, 
tighlty coupled, global variable dependencies,
and probably other bad forms. 
This advent of code is solely focused on solving the problems
presented with code, any means necessary. 


Maybe next years advent can include the challabgr of writing
modular, flexible and easily understandable code.
